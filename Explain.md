## This project is a Python implementation of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to find solutions, and it visualizes the problem's state space tree using Graphviz and pydot.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **State Space Tree** : In the context of this problem, a state space tree is a tree that represents all possible states of the game. Each node in the tree represents a state of the game (i.e., the number of missionaries, cannibals, and the side of the river the boat is on). The root of the tree is the initial state, and the leaf nodes are the possible final states.
2. **generate_full_space_tree.py** : This script generates the full state space tree up to a certain depth. It uses a breadth-first approach to explore all possible states of the game from the initial state. The generated tree is saved as a PNG image.
3. **solve.py** : This script contains the `Solution` class that implements the BFS and DFS algorithms to find a solution to the problem. It also contains functions to draw the state space tree and color the nodes based on their status (start state, goal state, invalid state, or other).
4. **main.py** : This script is the entry point of the application. It takes command-line arguments to determine the method (BFS or DFS) and whether to include legends on the graph. It then calls the appropriate method of the `Solution` class from [`solve.py`](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/SWARGA/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html "solve.py") to solve the problem and generate the graph.
5. **BFS and DFS** : These are two algorithms for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. BFS explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, while DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In this project, they are used to find a valid sequence of moves that leads from the initial state to the goal state.
6. **DFS/BFS Legend** : The legends on the graph help to understand the color coding of the nodes. For example, the start state might be colored blue, the goal state green, invalid states red, and other states orange. The legends explain this color coding.

Remember, the solution moves are displayed on the console, and the state space tree is saved as a PNG image in the current directory.
